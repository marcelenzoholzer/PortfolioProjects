# Portfolio Projects
In this directory you will find the portfolio projects I coded to showcase my R and Python skills. 
All of these portfolio projects are also featured on my [website](https://www.marcelholzer.com). I decided to create three projects for each programming language, so in total there are six portfolio projects. 

__Python:__
- web scraping & Exploratory Data Analysis (public data on characteristics of different ETFs)
- network analysis of the Harry Potter books and corresponding networks
- data cleaning / data preparation & machine learning project

__R:__
- geospatial dashboard representing data on the incidence and costs of different ICD diagnoses
- graphs on data from experimental psychology 
- data cleaning / data preparation / data analysis of example data that could be valuable for companies
