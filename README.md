# Portfolio Projects
In this directory you will find the portfolio projects I create to showcase my R and Python skills.

Results of the projects (e.g. graphs) are saved in the "issues" section of this repository, a link will also be provided at the end of each file or notebook.

At the moment, only one Python Project is online. However, I will continuously update this repository whenever I finish a new project. 

Currently you can find the following projects in this repository:
