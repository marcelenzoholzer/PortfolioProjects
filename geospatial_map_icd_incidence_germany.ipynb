    "# Geospatial Map of Germany\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook contains code to demonstrate a potential visualization (a geospatial choropleth map) of standardized inpatient treatment costs of a selected ICD-10-diagnosis across german federal lands (\"BundeslÃ¤nder\").\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar graph at other administrative levels (e.g. german distrcits) can be easily made by changing a few lines of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "I identified the following necessary tasks:\n",
    "1.) find and load an adequate GeoFile (preferably a ShapeFile, shp.) --> I used an official shape file from the Federal Ministry of Cartography of Germany\n",
    "2.) create random, but reproducable data to visualize standardized inpatient treatment costs (= e.g. costs per inhabitants)\n",
    "--> data on inpatient treatment costs in Germany can be requested from \"DeStatis\", the Federal Ministry of Statistics in Germany (\"DRG-Statistik\"). However, data from the Ministry are not free. Therefore, I decided to create my own, random data.\n",
    "3.) crate a plesant and informative graph with Matplotlib (other good options would have been Plotly or Seaborn)\n"
